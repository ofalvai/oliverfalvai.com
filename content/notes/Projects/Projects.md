### Active projects

#### [[notes/projects/Habit Builder]]

Android app I'm building for myself (primarily). A simple and clean app with the right tools to keep track of habits and understand progress.

#### Cycling infra map

A highly WIP OpenStreetMap-based vector map highlighting cycling infrastructure. The project is based on [Planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler), [tileserver-gl](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) and [Mapbox GL](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js). My code lives [here](https://github.com/ofalvai/planetiler-cycling-infra) and [here](https://github.com/ofalvai/custom-tileserver).

A live preview covering Europe is available [here](https://map.oliverfalvai.xyz/#13.44/47.50027/19.0455).

#### Home Assistant custom integrations

I maintain a few custom integrations for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), the open-source home automation system.
