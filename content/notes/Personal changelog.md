This is a regularly updated changelog of the various things I'm working on or playing with.

## 2023

### June
- My [[Home-cooked software]] has [a new tool called embeddings](https://github.com/ofalvai/homecooked/tree/main/embeddings): a CLI tool I built for exploring my Markdown notes using LLM embeddings.

### March
- Had a lot of fun learning Rust
- Learning a new language is a perfect excuse for making small tools for my own needs. [[Home-cooked software]] is the result of this.
