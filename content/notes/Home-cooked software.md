Inspired by [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/).

Unlike general-purpose software appealing to the widest audience, home-cooked software is purpose-built to solve my own niche problems. It's not designed to scale or solve everyone's problem and that's okay!

My home-cooked little programs live in this repo: https://github.com/ofalvai/homecooked
Take a look and have fun if any of them prove useful to you!
